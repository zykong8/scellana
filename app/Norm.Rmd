### *Normalizing the data*
After removing unwanted cells from the dataset, the next step is to normalize the data. By default, we employ a global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” that normalizes the feature expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 by default), and log-transforms the result. 

Next, we apply a linear transformation (‘scaling’) that is a standard pre-processing step prior to dimensional reduction techniques like PCA. The ScaleData() function:
- Shifts the expression of each gene, so that the mean expression across cells is 0
- Scales the expression of each gene, so that the variance across cells is 1
  - This step gives equal weight in downstream analyses, so that highly-expressed genes do not dominate
- By default, only variable features are scaled.
