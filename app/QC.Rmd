### *QC and selecting cells for further analysis*
Seurat allows you to easily explore QC metrics and filter cells based on any user-defined criteria. A few QC metrics commonly used by the community include

- The number of unique genes detected in each cell.
  - Low-quality cells or empty droplets will often have very few genes
  - Cell doublets or multiplets may exhibit an aberrantly high gene count
- Similarly, the total number of molecules detected within a cell (correlates strongly with unique genes)
- The percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome
  - Low-quality / dying cells often exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination
  - We calculate mitochondrial QC metrics with the PercentageFeatureSet() function, which calculates the percentage of counts originating from a set of features
  - We use the set of all genes starting with MT- as a set of mitochondrial genes
